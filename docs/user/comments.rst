Comments are useful in providing additional information to other members of your team (or other teams) about your alerts. Those with ADMIN, LEAD and USER roles can add comments to an alert, but VIEWERS can not. ADMINs can delete either their own or other people's comments. USERs can delete only their own comments. 

Adding Comments
----------------

Follow these steps:

* Open the alert definition where you want to add your comment.
* Either click on the top-right link `Comments` to add a **general** comment (for all entities), or click on the balloon on the left side of the entity name to add a comment on a **specific** entity.
* In the comments window, type your comment. Use as many lines as you need.
* Click the `Post comment` button and save your comment. Done!

Seeing Existing Comments
------------------------

It's easy: Just open the alert definition, then click on `Comments` (top-right link).

Deleting Comments
------------------

Deleting is also easy: Open the alert definition, click on the top right-link `Comments`, click on the cross above the comment, and delete.
