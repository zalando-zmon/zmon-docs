*****************
Monitoring on AWS
*****************

This section assumes that you're running zmon-aws-agent_, which automatically discovers your EC2 instances, auto-scaling of groups, ELBs, and more.

ZMON AWS agent syncs the following entities from AWS infrastructure:

- EC2 instances
- Auto-Scaling groups
- ELBs (classic and ELBv2)
- Elasticaches
- RDS instances
- DynamoDB tables
- IAM/ACM certificates

.. note::

    ZMON AWS Agent can be also deployed via a single `appliance`_, which runs AWS Agent, `ZMON worker`_ and `ZMON scheduler`_.

CloudWatch Metrics
------------------
You can achieve most basic monitoring with AWS CloudWatch_. CloudWatch EC2 metrics contain the following information:

- CPU Utilization
- Network traffic
- Disk throughput/operations per second (only for ephemeral storage; EBS volumes are not included)

ZMON allows querying arbitrary CloudWatch metrics using the :ref:`cloudwatch() <cloudwatch>` wrapper.

Security Groups
---------------

Depending on your AWS setup, you'll probably have to open particular ports/instances to access from ZMON. Using a limited set of ports to expose management APIs and the Prometheus node exporter will make your life easier. ZMON allows parsing of Prometheus metrics via the :ref:`http().prometheus() <http-prometheus>`.

You can deploy ZMON into each of your AWS accounts to allow cross-team monitoring and dashboards. Make sure that your security groups allow ZMON to connect to port 9100 of your monitored instances.

Not having the proper security groups configured is mainly visible by not getting the expected results at all, as packages are dropped by the EC2 instance rather then e.g. getting a connection refused.

Low-Level or Basic Properties
-----------------------------

EC2 Instances
=============

Having enough **diskspace** on your instance is important; `here's a sample check`_. By default, you can only get space used from CloudWatch_. Using Amazon's own script, you can push free space to CloudWatch and pull this data via ZMON. Alternatively, you can run the `Prometheus Node exporter`_ to pull disk space data from the EC2 node itself via HTTP.

Similarly, you can pull CPU-related metrics from CloudWatch. The Prometheus Node exporter also exposes these metrics.

You also need enough available **INodes**.

Regarding **memory**, you can either query via CloudWatch, use Prometheus Node exporter to feed ZMON, or go with low-level ``snmp()`` [not recommended].

The following block shows *part* of EC2 instance entity properties:

.. code-block:: yaml

    id: a-app-1-2QBrR1[aws:123456789:eu-west-1]
    type: instance
    aws_id: i-87654321
    created_by: agent
    host: 172.33.173.201
    infrastructure_account: aws:123456789
    instance_type: t2.medium
    ip: 172.33.173.201
    ports:
      '5432': 5432
      '8008': 8008
    region: eu-west-1

An example check using :ref:`cloudwatch wrapper <cloudwatch>` and entity properties would look like the following:

.. code-block:: python

    cloudwatch().query_one({'InstanceId': entity['aws_id']}, 'CPUUtilization', 'Average', 'AWS/EC2', period=120)


Elastic Load Balancers
======================

You can query AWS CloudWatch to get ELB-specific metrics. The ZMON agent will put data into the ELB entity, allowing you to monitor instance and healthy instance count.

.. code-block:: yaml

    id: elb-a-app-1[aws:123456789:eu-west-1]
    type: elb
    elb_type: classic
    active_members: 1
    created_by: agent
    dns_name: internal-a-app-1.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com
    host: internal-a-app-1.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com
    infrastructure_account: aws:123456789
    members: 3
    region: eu-west-1
    scheme: internal

ZMON AWS agent will detect both ELBs, classic and application load balancers. Both ELBs entities will be created in ZMON with ``type:elb``. In order to distinguish between them in your checks, there is another property ``elb_type`` which holds either ``classic`` or ``application``.

Since Cloudwatch metrics are different for each ELB type, please check `CloudWatch ELB metrics`_ for detailed reference. An example check using :ref:`Cloudwatch wrapper <cloudwatch>` and entity properties would look like the following:

.. code-block:: python

    # Classic ELB
    lb_name = entity['name']
    key = 'LoadBalancerName'
    namespace = 'AWS/ELB'

    # Check if Application ELBv2 entity
    if entity.get('elb_type') == 'application':
        lb_name = entity['cloudwatch_name']
        key = 'LoadBalancer'
        namespace = 'AWS/ApplicationELB'

    cloudwatch().query_one({key: lb_name}, 'RequestCount', 'Sum', namespace)

.. note::

    ELB entities contain a special flag ``dns_traffic`` which is an indicator about the load balancer being actively serving traffic.

Auto-Scaling Groups
===================

ZMON's agent creates an auto-scaling group entity that provides you with the number of desired instances and the number of instances in a healthy state. This enables you to monitor whether the ASG actually works and hosts spawn into a productive state.

.. code-block:: yaml

    id: asg-proxy-1[aws:123456789:eu-central-1]
    type: asg
    name: proxy-1
    created_by: agent
    desired_capacity: 2
    dns_traffic: 'true'
    dns_weight: 200
    infrastructure_account: aws:123456789
    instances:
    - aws_id: i-123456
      ip: 172.33.109.201
    - aws_id: i-654321
      ip: 172.33.109.202
    max_size: 4
    min_size: 2
    region: eu-central-1

RDS Instances
=============

ZMON AWS agent will detect RDS instances and store them as entities with type ``database``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    id: rds-db-1[aws:123456789]
    type: database
    name: db-1
    created_by: agent
    engine: postgres
    host: db-1.rds.amazonaws.com
    infrastructure_account: aws:123456789
    port: 5432
    region: eu-west-1

.. code-block:: python

    cloudwatch().query_one({'DBInstanceIdentifier': entity['name']}, 'DatabaseConnections', 'Sum', 'AWS/RDS')

ElastiCache Redis
=================

Elasticache instances are stored as entities with type ``elc``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    id: elc-redis-1[aws:123456789:eu-central-1]
    type: elc
    cluster_id: all-redis-001
    cluster_num_nodes: 1
    created_by: agent
    engine: redis
    host: redis-1.cache.amazonaws.com
    infrastructure_account: aws:123456789
    port: 6379
    region: eu-central-1

IAM/ACM Certificates
====================

ZMON AWS agent will also sync IAM/ACM SSL certificates, with type ``certificate``. Certificate entities could be used to create an alert in case a certificate is about to expire for instance.

.. code-block:: yaml

    id: cert-acm-example.org[aws:123456789:eu-central-1]
    type: certificate
    name: '*.example.org'
    status: ISSUED
    arn: arn:aws:acm:eu-central-1:123456789:certificate/123456-123456-123456-123456
    certificate_type: acm
    created_by: agent
    expiration: '2017-07-28T12:00:00+00:00'
    infrastructure_account: aws:123456789
    region: eu-central-1


Application API Monitoring
--------------------------

When monitoring an application, you'll usually want to check the number of received requests, latency patterns, and the number of returned status codes. These data points form a pretty clear picture of what is going on with the application.

Additional metrics will help you find problems as well as opportunities for improvement. Assuming that your applications provide HTTP APIs hidden behind ELBs, you can use ZMON to gather this data from CloudWatch.

For more detailed data, ZMON offers options for different languages and frameworks. One is zmon-actuator_, for Spring Boot. ZMON gathers the data by querying a JSON endpoint adhering to the DropWizard metrics standard with some convention on the naming of timers, but basically on timer per API PATH and status code.

We also recommend checking out Friboo_ for working with Clojure, and the Python/Flask framework Connexion_.

The :ref:`http(url=...).actuator_metrics() <http-actuator>` will parse the data into a Python dict that allows you to easily monitor and alert on changes in API behavior.
